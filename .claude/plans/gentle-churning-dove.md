# Task Breakdown Plan for Booking Context Design

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach for improving the booking-context-breakdown.md file to make it actionable and aligned with project standards. The current file has formatting and content issues that prevent it from being properly structured for implementation.

## Current State Analysis
The booking-context-breakdown.md file exists but has several issues:
1. It lacks proper task identification with a unique ID
2. It doesn't include required metadata sections like Context Independent flag
3. It's missing the "Files to Edit" section that's standard in other task files
4. It doesn't have a clear verification section
5. It doesn't include proper evidence references

## Implementation Approach
The plan is to update the booking-context-breakdown.md file to follow the exact same structure as the other task breakdown files (iam-context-breakdown.md and payment-context-breakdown.md) in the tasks directory.

## Key Improvements Required

### 1. Add Proper Task Identification
- Add a unique task ID following the project's naming convention (e.g., BOOK-CTX-BRK-01)
- Include Context Independent flag set to YES

### 2. Add Required Metadata Sections
- Add "Files to Edit" section that references the booking context design file
- Add "Verification" criteria section with specific completion requirements
- Add "Evidence" section with references to supporting documentation

### 3. Enhance Subtasks Detail
- Make subtasks more specific and actionable
- Ensure each subtask aligns with the context design requirements
- Include implementation guidance where appropriate

### 4. Maintain Consistency
- Follow the exact same structure as existing task files
- Use the same heading formats and section organization
- Maintain consistent formatting and markdown style

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update File Structure
1. Add proper YAML frontmatter with task identification
2. Add Context Independent flag
3. Add Files to Edit section
4. Add Verification criteria section
5. Add Evidence section

### Step 2: Refine Subtasks
1. Make each subtask more specific and actionable
2. Ensure alignment with context design requirements
3. Include implementation guidance where needed

### Step 3: Verify Consistency
1. Compare with existing task files (iam-context-breakdown.md, payment-context-breakdown.md)
2. Ensure all sections are present and properly formatted
3. Validate that the structure matches project standards

## Expected Outcome
After implementation, the booking-context-breakdown.md file will:
- Follow the exact same format as other task files in the repository
- Include all required metadata sections
- Have specific, actionable subtasks
- Include proper verification and evidence criteria
- Be ready for review and implementation
- Align with all project documentation standards

## Critical Files to Modify
- /home/tonny/workspace/booking_payment_ollama/tasks/booking-context-breakdown.md

## Verification
The updated file should:
1. Match the structure of iam-context-breakdown.md and payment-context-breakdown.md exactly
2. Include all required metadata sections
3. Have properly detailed subtasks
4. Follow the project's documentation standards
5. Be ready for implementation by development teams
